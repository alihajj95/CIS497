	The installation is simple. Un-zip the archive.
	Upload the whole archive into a web folder you create on your hosting server.

	So you need a FTP-client like Filezilla, login to your server, create a 
	special folder on your hosting for this app (e.g. mydropbox), then
	upload all the files in the archive there.

	Then, access install.php where you have a 1-page simple and quick installation.

	And that's it. 
	
	We wanted to keep the web-app light, so you can include it easily into your projects
	and also use it as stand-alone application. No mySql database.
	
	
	Now, access it on the web, and see how it looks like.

	Thanks for buying our app.


	P.S. Please keep the file "index.php" in the "uploaded-files" folder, it is a blank page that's intended to show an empty page when somebody's accessing the folder directly from the web, with no password. 
	

	For the main documentation page, check out documentation.php file (load it in your browser.)


	Enjoy
